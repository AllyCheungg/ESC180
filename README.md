# ESC180
This respository hosts the labs I completed in the Introduction to Computer Programming course (ESC180) :happy:

######Lab0
Lab0 is an introductory lab about python syntax and basic arithmetics.

######Lab1
Cow tracking technology
These functions will ensure Alice and Bob’s cows are safe and accounted for: 
1. Given a cow’s position and the boundary points of the cow’s enclosure, determine whether the cow is inside the farm
2. Calculate shortest distance between the cow and the boundary point
3. Calculate the time it will take for the cow to escape the farm
4. Report on the cow's status

######Lab2
Re-establish connection with Professor Supernova from Proxima Centauri b using vector operations such as a projection that I learnt from ESC103 in the EngSci curriculum
lab2_1 contains VECTOR OPERATIONS
lab2_2 returns a list indicating all the indices of the bit errors which occurred between the sending of packet1 and the receiving of packet2 and the number of bit errors that have occurred in the transmission from packet1 to packet2.
lab2_3 is a bit calculator which converts dec to binary number. It also checks if the bit calculation is correct, if it is wrong solely due to bit overflow or if it is wrong due to bit overflow is not enough to account for errors in result.

######Lab3
Image manipulation
- rotate_90_degrees
- flip_image
- invert grayscale
- crop
- rgb_to_grayscale
- invert_rgb

######Lab4
AI Story writing
Use an n-gram model to generate an original text inspired by existing texts. The main idea behind the n-gram model is to predict the next word in a text based on the previous
n words

######Lab5
Google search engine simplified
Create a simple binary search tree (BST) to return one result when searching for a webpage, displaying the time
it took, and displaying the power of searching a large number of webpages in an O(logN) complexity as opposed to
O(n).
